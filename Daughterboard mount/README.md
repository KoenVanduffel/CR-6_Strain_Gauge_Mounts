The mounts will not allow the original hotend cover to be mounted any more. Hence there is a mount for the daugfhterboard and a 5015 part fan.
The stock 4010 part fan mount is to follow soon.


These are not needed for the Bowden setup's. In that case the stock hotend cover still fits. Feel free to use them however.

The Part fan Shroud V2 is an improved version of the part fan shroud featureing a more flat oriented airflow giving better cooling performance at the backside of the part (relative to the cooling fan).

For the daughterboard mount there are 2 options. One to mount the daughterboard bare and one to mount it with the original plastick back to enable the use of the blue LED.
