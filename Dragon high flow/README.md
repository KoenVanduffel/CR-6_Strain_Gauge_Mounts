# Dragon high flow hotenders
The Dragon high flow hotend (TriangleLabs and Phaetus version are nearly identical and fit both) has a strong reputation of being a reasonably priced high qualtiy hotend. Personally i prefer the high flow version as it hasn't shown any of the disadvantages sometimes attributed to a high flow hotend but does have the advantage of being capable of melting al lot of plastic.

There are 3 extruder options:
* Bowden setup
* Orbiter **V1.5** (high performace large gear extruder)
* Mjolnir extruder (3d printed BMG clone)

A version using the Voron Galileo Clockwork extruder is in the planning. The Galileo Clockwork uses the internals of the Orbiter and will thus perform very similar.

There have been multiple requests to make a Bondtech LGX or Superfly version. These extruders are however too bulky and simply don't fit in the space available. To mount these they have to be lifted over the carriage back plate which will increase vibrations as the momentum on the strain gauge is increased.
