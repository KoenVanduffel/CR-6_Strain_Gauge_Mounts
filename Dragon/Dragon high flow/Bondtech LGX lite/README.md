A first iteration of a mount for the all new Bondtech LGX Lite extruder directly on the strain gauge of a Creality CR-6, CR-6 Max and most probably CR-10 smart as well.

This design is UNTESTED for now as I do not have access to a Bondtech LGX Lite.

Mounting follows the same principles of the Orbiter mounts. I am working on an exploded view video to show the order of events to mount the Extruder.
