The added connection of top and bottom on the left side makes the use of exact tolerance necessary. A tolerance test piece is added please print this with the exact same settings as you intend to print the mount (don't cheap out on layer nr off walls as it might give you a false reading). The recommended print settings are one directory up.

Main changes versus V3:

- make the fan outlet compatible with both standard and high flow Dragons

- Add a cutout to ease access to the daughter board mount screw

- connect the top and bottom on the left side to make the mount very sturdy and avoid fatigue. (there have been reports of the mount failing after a number of months due to the main force being concentrated perpendicular to the layer lines instead of parallel)
