![CR-6 stoch hotend and Mjolnir extruder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13643644/121420490-6d75ff80-c96d-11eb-8e20-81ab705ebe86.png)

Mount the Mjolnir extruder directly on the CR-6 SE and MAX hotend.

There are 2 "front" files. One has a flat bottom, the other one an extension to guide the Bowden tube. Please try what suits best.

The Boden tube length will be critical as it has to press down on the hot end to avoid cloggs but not too much so as not to deform and cause a restriction to the filament path. The Bowden tube should be 55 mm.
