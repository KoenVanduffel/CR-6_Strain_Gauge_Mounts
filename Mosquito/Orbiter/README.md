# The Mosquito plus Orbiter mount direct to the strain gauge

The mount for the Mosquito - Orbiter combination to the strain gauge. The file marked injection molding inserts is meant to be used with the typical IM inserts. The preferred inserts are the regular hot melt inserts as they give a much stronger part.

The regular 5015 part blower fan mount does not fit! A modified version to fit the wide Mosquito heater block is incuded here.
