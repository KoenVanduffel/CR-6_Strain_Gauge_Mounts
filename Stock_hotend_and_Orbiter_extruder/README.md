# Mount block to mount the Orbiter extruder to the stock CR-6 hotend.

There are 4 versions available:

  The version with the flat bottom leaves the PTFE tube open in the top part of the hot end which should be suficient. You can also opt for the second version  with the PTFE tube path to constrain the PTFE tube a bit more.
  
  Both are available for mounts with hot melt inserts (the preferred way of mounting) and M3 nuts.
