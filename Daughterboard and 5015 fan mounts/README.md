The mounts will not allow the original hotend cover to be mounted any more. Hence there is a mount for the daugfhterboard and a 5015 part fan.
The stock 4010 part fan mount is to follow soon.


These are not needed for the Bowden setup's. In that case the stock hotend cover still fits. Feel free to use them however.
