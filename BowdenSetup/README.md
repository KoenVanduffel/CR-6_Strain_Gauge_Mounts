#Creality CR-6 SE and CR-6 MAX Bowden mounted Dragon hotend.

4 variants are available:
	
	High flow Dragon with the fan shroud slightly higher mounted to avoid cooling the extended heatzone
	Standard flow Dragon with fan shroud mounted lower
	
	For both versions there is a choice between a version with:
    M3 bolts and nuts
    M3 bolts and hot melt inserts. For the fan 2 3mm long M3 hot melts are sufficient,
		longer is possible. For the mount to the strain gauge 7 mm long M3 hot melts are recommended.

Print prefereably in PETG or other high Tg material. The bottom of the fan shroud might sag when printing in PLA.

Printing:

	0.16 mm layer height
	activate "Use Adaptive Layers" with maximum variation and step size 0.04 mm and Topography size 0.2 mm
	0.44 mm line width
	4 walls, top and bottom layers
	Activate "Alternative Extra Wall" in the walls menu of Cura
	20% Gyroid infill (Gyroid provides good vibration damping)
	No supports, the holes and screw tread print good enough on my CR-6
	Print at high temperature (240 or 245 Â°C for PETG)
	You might ocnsider upping the flow rate to 105% to get maximum part strenth. Experiment with this setting if needed.
  

Mounting:
	
	Mount the Dragon with the supplied bolts
	Mount the fan with 16 or 18 mm M3 bolts
	Mount the assembly to the strain gauge with 10 mm M3 bolts
	
	The 10 mm Bowden coupler is screwd directly in the platic thread. Do not overtighten!
