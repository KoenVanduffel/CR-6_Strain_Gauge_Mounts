The files in this directory are kept here for those who printed and are using the original version of the Dragon & Orbiter mount.

Carefull inspetion of the model showed a deviation in the placement of the nozzle in the original mount. The Dragon hot end is places 1.3 mm higher than the nozzle of the original Creality setup. V2 corrects this.

For most people this mod will work fine but some might see their X-gantry crash into the optical sensor. Hence this small difference is corrected in V2.

The part fan mount has been further improved. The thickness of the shroud is increased on the upper side to inprove strength. Tollerances of the mount pount are adjusted after several prints to avoid a too tight fit.
