----Difference between V1 and V2------

V1 had a slight misalignment in the nozzle position (1.3mm too high) versus the stock CR6 hotend. In V2 this has been corrected. For any new installation please use V2. If you have a V1 mount use the V1 shroud, it is identical except 1.3 mm higher positioned outlet to accommodate the misalignement.

The mount present now is the one for hot melt inserts. The one using nuts will follow soon.

Mounts to install the Dragon hotend and Orbiter extruder directly on the CR-6 SE amd MAX strain gauge.


The 5015 part fan mount has been designed after a lot of iteration with the help of Alex. The idea is that it comes very close to the build plate and surrounds the sock with about 1 mm in order to push as much air as possible close to the nozzle. The roudings at the sides are to ensure the air is pushed back inwards behind the nozzle to also cool the freshly laid plastic when the nozzle moves towards the fan shroud.
This  is believed to be more effective than a twin fang design where both airflows will inevitably collide and cause certain angles to get little to no airflow ar all.

Printed in PETG the fan shroud has been tested with the hotend at 300 °C with the nozzle at 0.2 mm from the hot bed at 110 °C wiht the part fan itself off.
