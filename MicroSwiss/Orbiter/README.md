# MicroSwiss and Orbiter

The mount has been moved to PrusaPrinters.org. The new version is identical to the one for the stock hotend.

[PrusaPrinters](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/132112-cr-6-direct-drive-stock-or-microswiss-hotend-orbit)

This mount is menat to install the Orbiter extruder and MicroSwiss CR-6 hotend in direct drive mode directly onto the CR-6 SE or CR-6 Max strain gauge.

There is not hotend in the render file as MicroSwiss hasnt released a CAD file of the extruder. If anyone has a CAD file please notify me so I can integrate it in the render for convenience.

Many thanks to @ritchiedc on the CR-6 discord for providing me the necessary measurements to adapt the existing mounts to the MicroSwiss hotend.
