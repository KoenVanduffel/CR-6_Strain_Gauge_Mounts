Creating this directory instead of a new branch, to hold models of prototypes and records of experiments performed in support of CR-6_Strain_Gauge_Mounts development and troubleshooting.
Since this repository is holding models, not code files, the concepts of "merging" and "conflicts" do not apply in the same way. 
Seems wasteful to clone the entire Main branch, just to add a few new files, but seems appropriate to keep these files apart from the Main repository.
If a new model should be "pulled" into Main, a Pull Request/Commit should allow that.  I think...
